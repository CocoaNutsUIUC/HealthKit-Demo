It is a simple framework for managing health-related data across apps on iPhone and Apple Watch. If you are developing a health & fitness app, HealthKit allows you to accesss and store various types of user data like weight and height or blood pressure in an encrpted database. 

With some hardwares, HealthKit also allow you to directly save data from the device. For example, "*in iOS 8.0, the system can automatically save data from compatible Bluetooth LE heart rate monitors.*" (from Apple)
